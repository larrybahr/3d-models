This reinforced replacement chair foot glide is designed for Bertolini chairs, offering superior durability over factory models. 
With thicker and taller walls, it provides a tighter/more secure fit and improved stength reducing breakage—especially when stacking chairs.

It features thicker and taller walls to prevent breakage and give it a tighter fit, especially when stacking chairs.  The upgraded design helps prevent slipping, enhancing both stability and longevity over the original https://bertolinidirect.com/products/accessories/glides.

I printed mine in clear OVERTURE high speed 95A TPU and they are working great!

A Blender file of the design is available if you’d like to make any modifications or improvements.
